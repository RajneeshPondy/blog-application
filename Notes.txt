QuerySets are only evaluated in the following cases:
• The first time you iterate over them
• When you slice them, for instance, Post.objects.all()[:3]
• When you pickle or cache them
• When you call repr() or len() on them
• When you explicitly call list() on them
• When you test them in a statement, such as bool(), or, and, or if
